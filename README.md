# Lab_Preposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
1) BlackJack Game that puts the user against an AI dealer in an attempt to win the hand.
2) A Game in python that is like a classic arcade game, was thinking about something like Pac-Man or Frogger as I feel like they'd be a bit simpler than Mario or another game.
